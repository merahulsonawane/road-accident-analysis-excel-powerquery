# road-accident-analysis-excel-powerquery
  This project analyzes road accident data using Microsoft Excel with Power Query for data cleaning and transformation. The dataset was processed to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize fields. Key insights were generated through pivot tables, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards to identify accident trends, high-risk locations, time-based patterns, and severity distribution. The project demonstrates practical Excel skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization for real-world decision-making.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/merahulsonawane/road-accident-analysis-excel-powerquery/blob/main/Datasets.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total number of road accidents and fatalities, and how has it changed over time?
- Casualties by Vehicle Type.
- CY vs PY Casualty Trend (Monthly).
- Casualties by Road Type.
- Casualties by Road Surface Condition
- Urban vs Rural Casualties
- Light Condition Analysis (Day vs Night)

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/merahulsonawane/road-accident-analysis-excel-powerquery/blob/main/Dashboard%20Image.png">View Dashboard</a>

## What have I created?
- Visual blocks with key performance indicators (KPIs) to give a quick summary.
- A summary of casualties grouped by type of vehicle.
- A line chart comparing current year (CY) vs previous year (PY) month-wise data.
- Compare accident counts across different road types.
- Show how many casualties occurred on dry, wet, or snow-covered roads.
- Compare how many accidents happened in Urban vs Rural areas.
- Determine when most accidents happen — during daylight or darkness.
- Interactive panel to filter data based on:
- Clickable icons that navigate to the dataset or pivot pages.

## Project Insight
- Road accidents are not evenly distributed; a limited set of locations accounts for a high percentage of total incidents.
- Peak hours show consistently higher accident frequency, suggesting traffic volume and driver behavior as major contributors.
- Most accidents result in non-fatal injuries, but fatal cases significantly increase during late-night and early-morning hours.
- Certain vehicle categories are repeatedly involved in severe accidents, indicating higher exposure or risk patterns.
- Time-based and location-based analysis shows clear patterns that can support targeted road safety and enforcement strategies.

## Final Conclusion
  This project demonstrates how Excel with Power Query can be effectively used to clean, transform, and analyze road accident data. The analysis reveals clear patterns across time, location, and severity, showing that accidents are concentrated in specific hotspots and peak periods rather than occurring randomly. These insights can support data-driven decisions for improving road safety and highlight Excel’s capability as a practical tool for real-world data analysis.
