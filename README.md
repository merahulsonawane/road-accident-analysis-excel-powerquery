# road-accident-analysis-excel-powerquery
This project analyzes road accident data using Microsoft Excel with Power Query for data cleaning and transformation. The dataset was processed to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize fields. Key insights were generated through pivot tables, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards to identify accident trends, high-risk locations, time-based patterns, and severity distribution. The project demonstrates practical Excel skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization for real-world decision-making.

## What have I created?
- Visual blocks with key performance indicators (KPIs) to give a quick summary.
- A summary of casualties grouped by type of vehicle.
- A line chart comparing current year (CY) vs previous year (PY) month-wise data.
- Compare accident counts across different road types.
- Show how many casualties occurred on dry, wet, or snow-covered roads.
- Compare how many accidents happened in Urban vs Rural areas.
